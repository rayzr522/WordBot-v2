# WordBot-v2

This is a copy of [@abyssvi's WordBot](http://github.com/abyssvi/WordBot), because I have way too much time and I'm overly competitive. Written in less than 10 minutes, using only 1 line of code, and no cheating with semicolons to join lines.

## Installation

This isn't the most friendly installation, since I didn't include any error checking for the config. Just edit the config to your liking, you may have to play around with it for a bit.

#### Requirements

- git ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) | [macOS](https://git-scm.com/download/macOS) | [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux))
- node ([Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) | [macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) | [Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))
- yarn ([Windows](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-tab) | [macOS](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-tab) | [Linux](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#linux-tab))

#### Downloading

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rayzr522/WordBot-v2
cd WordBot-v2
yarn install
yarn start
```

That should be enough to get you started. The bot is (not surprisingly) very lightweight.
